Short Answer: The reason I decided to learn Software Engineering is that it interests me
.
Long Answer: I am motivated to learn a new skillset that I can use for the rest of my life. Growing up hearing the stories of all the great minds such as Steve Jobs and Michael Dell has made me fascinated in the technology industry. Programming allows you to build things others can only dream and the lifestyle that programmers possess is a plus as well.
I not only want to receive a job as a software engineer, but I have a personal interest in learning these skills , to simply create the things I want to make.
