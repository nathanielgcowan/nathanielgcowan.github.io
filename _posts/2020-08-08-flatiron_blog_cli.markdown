This is a Blog about my first project here with Flatiron. I created a command-line interface that scrapes data from a website and gives the returned values to the user. This was a great learning experience for me and I know what I have done this last week has given me skills that I can use throughout the rest of my career. Throughout this article I'm going to go over what my project does and what I would do differently if I had to make this project again.

 I built my project around the website Austin Swing Syndicate. This organization hosts different parties and afternoon gatherings for locals to meet up and swing dance. The goal of my scraper was to take the different events hosted by Austin Swing Syndicate and list them for the viewer. So that once the viewer will click on a specific  party they wouldn't be greeted with a full description of the party as well as the date of that party.

 This was proved easier said than done. In fact starting this project was like drinking water from a fire hose. It was difficult to take everything that I've learned So far and implement all at once. But after breaking down code into small pieces I was able to form a plan of attack that helped me get through this project.

  Upon Initialization  I wanted my viewer to be welcomed to the command line interface.  This was accomplished through the call method. Which I defined first is the program. The next step I took to finish my project was declaring the environment file. here I put the required_ function to work and made sure that all the files within my program were connected. Once this was done I began building out my command line interface.

The CLI can be broken down into three sections.  Firstly, the program must get the information from the website Second, the program must list that information. and third the program must retrieve the answer provided the input made by the user. This was possible through the use of instance variables. not the instance variables for the sole reason in completing code, put that these tools were a great way to bring data from one  file and use it in code for another..

As my data on my command line interface setup I went on to the Fine two different classes, the party and description class. These two classes take on arguments that my program would need in order to go and accomplish the desired task. This is also where the instance variables as one stated earlier would all basically live. The result of writing a program in this way was that everything in the program would “talk” to one another.

Once this was completed I worked on my scraper. Up to this point I have been using fake data in my CLI’s listed array to get my program to work. This proved helpful because I was able to build my scraper and avoid syntax errors until completion. In fact, helpful enough that it was rather easy to get the scraper to work because once the scraper was completed the object's orientation filtered out the information that was required from the get-go.

At this point I was a estatic I completed my first project withFlatiron.  My command line interface was able to successfully bring information from Austin Swing Syndicate and display the party  description and date when asked for. Looking back on my project now that I have completed the task I would say if I had to make any changes I would most likely change two things. One, my project would use less code to accomplish the same task, which would streamline the system processing.Second, I would to go further then one level of code down send the application, because I would be able to use that much more data within my program. But overall I'm proud of all that I have accomplished within this project and I am ready to take on more.
